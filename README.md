# simple-notes-taking-api
## Overview
Build a RESTful API for a simple note-taking application using Node.js and Express. This application will allow for creating, fetching, querying, and updating notes without user management. No UI needs to be developed. If you can attach a Swagger UI to test these APIs, even better.
